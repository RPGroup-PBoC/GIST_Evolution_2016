    "Approximately 200 miles off the coast of Brazil exists a small (and quite beautiful) archipelago named [Fernando de Noronha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_de_Noronha). The twenty one islands and islets of this archipelago are volcanic in origin and have many endemic plant and animal species. One curious inhabitant of the archipelago is [*Mabuya atlantica*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noronha_skink) (also known as the Noronha skink), which is phylogenetically placed along with the African species of *Trachylepis*. Because the archipelago was formed from volcanoes, there was no way that these lizards traveled to the island by land. How did they arrive at the island? In 1888, Alfred Russel Wallace proposed that perhaps the skink arrived on the archipelago by floating on a raft of vegetation across the open ocean, although this trip was estimated to take around 150 days using the knowledge of the oceanic currents from Africa to South America, as is shown in the figure below. \n",

    "While the exact trajectory of this 'improbable voyage' is still up for debate, the phylogenetic placement of this species is fairly certain. This placement was not performed through morphology but through DNA sequence analysis. In this tutorial, we will use the data from [S. Carranza and E. N. Arnold](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1017/S1477200003001099?journalCode=tsab20) who sequenced a component of the mitochondrial DNA from a large variety of skinks across the world and from Fernando de Noronha. We will learn how to read in the DNA sequences and score them by the similarity of their sequence to test this hypothesis. "
